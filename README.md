# Windows spotlight background manager

This program copies the images Windows 10 fetches from Bing to use as lock-screen when "Windows Spotlight" is selected as source in the control panel. This allows you to use these images as normal background. 

The best way to use this is to create a scheduled task which is triggered upon login and unlock.
